### Hi there universe ( well for now humans and web crawlers) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently contributing to [Gluster](https://github.com/gluster), it is a Free and Open source clustered network filesystem.

Apart from that I sometimes tinker around with some small projects. I've been also working on..
1. [json-c-wrapper](https://github.com/srijan-sivakumar/json-c-wrapper)
2. [libdocker](https://github.com/srijan-sivakumar/libdocker)

I would be happy if anyone would love to contribute to these projects. It can be even something as basic as adding a semi-colon...that's how I started way back..

For those looking to learn some basics of glusterfs, I have written some blog posts, you can refer to them : [Glusterfs](https://medium.com/@sivakumarsrijan/the-glusterfs-journey-3439bd971c5e?source=friends_link&sk=ae7f28d590d0c0345ee7a115e2563468)
